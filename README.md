# INT-1.2-AND-INT-2.2-Winter-Intensive

## Course Description

You’ll work by yourself to design, code, and ship your own new app or website. This product (app or website) will be part of your project “portfolio” that employers will eventually look at when hiring. On **Friday, we’ll pitch** our product to classmates.

**INT 1.2** is for Juniors while **INT 2.2** is for Seniors.  Students will work on similar skills with different evaluation criteria and expectations.

## Prerequisites:  

- none

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Build from scratch an app or product in your language concentration
1. Explain the value of your product via a product pitch
1. Provide and receive constructive feedback on your app idea, designs, and code
1. Create high quality README.md’s


## Product Requirements

1. **Juniors: You will work solo on your project - not with a partner.** This allows you to gain full stack experience instead of just using skills you are comfortable with. You’ll work on a team project again for Term 3 SPD and the Spring Intensive. 
1. **Juniors: Your product can be a new project or an extension of an SPD 1.2 project.** This new project will help you broaden your portfolio, demonstrating your variety of skills. Term 3 SPD and Spring Intensive will be a group project.
1. **Seniors: You can work on an old or new project** Seniors must fill out the [Senior Intensive Proposal Document](make.sc/senior-int-proposal) to scope their project.
