# INT-1.2-AND-INT-2.2-Winter-Intensive

## Course Description

You’ll work by yourself to design, code, and ship your own new app or website. This product (app or website) will be part of your project “portfolio” that employers will eventually look at when hiring. On **Friday, we’ll pitch** our product to classmates. The Intensive will end the following **Tuesday with an “Open House”** where students will present their projects “science fair” style.

**INT 1.2** is for Juniors while **INT 2.2** is for Seniors.  Students will work on similar skills with different evaluation criteria and expectations.

Total Seat Hours:  35 hours <br>
Total Out-of-Class Hours: 25 hours <br>
Total Hours: 60 hours <br>
Units:  1 unit <br>

## Prerequisites:  

- none

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Build from scratch an app or product in your language concentration
1. Explain the value of your product via a product pitch
1. Provide and receive constructive feedback on your app idea, designs, and code
1. Create high quality README.md’s


## Product Requirements

1. **Juniors: You will work solo on your project - not with a partner.** This allows you to gain full stack experience instead of just using skills you are comfortable with. You’ll work on a team project again for Term 3 SPD and the Spring Intensive. 
1. **Juniors: Your product can be a new project or an extension of an SPD 1.2 project.** This new project will help you broaden your portfolio, demonstrating your variety of skills. Term 3 SPD and Spring Intensive will be a group project.
1. **Seniors: You can work on an old or new project** Seniors must fill out the [Senior Intensive Proposal Document](make.sc/senior-int-proposal) to scope their project.

### Projects

**All projects require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Attend all class sessions
- Submit daily deliverables in the [Intensive Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iUDJZcJRtlYQEuV5KxInafn5B0R69hbxv9PLeEhRDlA/edit#gid=0).

- **Pitch slides & presentation (due Fri Jan 10th @ 3:00pm)** - passes if scores above a 1 on the [Presentation Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WTLcZNyvRGYDz5L8Kr8a0ILbFAyr92u85paoqGFjxPg/edit).

Each student will present their product. ([Class slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pwUefBG8C-WjebEYp0bzLc3OPYgFu5ZNivCAl_FPutE/edit#slide=id.g4d412370b7_0_63))
